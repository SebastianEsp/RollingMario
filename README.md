Implementation of the Rolling Horizon Evolutionary Algorithm (RHEA) for the automatic playing of Super Mario levels. 
This project uses the [Mario AI framework](https://github.com/amidos2006/Mario-AI-Framework) which is commonly used for using AI methods with a version of Super Mario Bros.

Rolling Horizon is a statistical forward planning algorithm in the same family as the more popular Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This project was done as part of a course on artifical intelligence in video games.
The implemeted algorithm is capable of succesfully playing a wide variety of Super Mario levels in real time.

------
#### How to use
To run the algorithm open the PlayLevel file and execute.
Additonal information about the framework can be found on the Mario AI framework [github] (https://github.com/amidos2006/Mario-AI-Framework)
